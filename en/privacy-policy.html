<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p class="updated">Last updated: 17 January 2026</p>

<div class="intro-box">
<p>This is the Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) of TIMING INTERACTION (a French company registered with the Paris Trade and Companies Register under number SIREN 991 278 284 and whose registered office is located at 24 rue du Cotentin, PARIS – 75015) (“TIMING CORPORATION” or “we”). The Policy describes how we collect and use information, including personal information about you (the “User” or “you”) when you play the ABSOLUTE CINEMA Game or other future games published by TIMING CORPORATION (each a “Game” and collectively the “Games”).</p>

<p>Our services may be accessible via a web browser, social networks (for example, Facebook) or as an application on various platforms (for example, the App Store, Google Play Store).</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact TIMING CORPORATION at the following email address: contact.timingcorporation@gmail.com</p>
</div>

<p>When you play our Game, we will collect and store personal data about you which we will use for various purposes, as explained in this Policy. Most of this data is necessary to allow you to access and play our Games.</p>

<p>However, in some cases, we may ask you to provide us with other personal data or use your personal data for purposes that are not essential to the operation of the Game. In such a case, you are not required to provide us with such data and you have the right to refuse its use (if the same data is used for other purposes). For example, we may ask for your email address to recover your password. We will not use it for other purposes without informing you in advance and without giving you the opportunity to refuse or give your consent, depending on the case.</p>

<p>Our Game displays advertisements, and on many devices, the advertisements you see are personalized using a specific advertising identifier on your device. You can disable ad personalization for all of your apps and disable the advertising identifier in your device settings. However, you will continue to receive ads, but they will not be personalized. You will find more information on advertising and advertising identifiers in Sections 5 and 6.</p>

<p>You have the right to object to the use of your personal data and to exercise other rights to access and control its use. These rights include in particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>Request access to the personal data we hold about you;</li>
<li>Request that we correct inaccurate data about you;</li>
<li>Request that we delete personal data about you;</li>
<li>The right to lodge a complaint with the competent authorities if you believe we do not comply with applicable data protection regulations;</li>
</ul>

<p>Your rights and how to exercise them are detailed in Section 4.</p>

<p>Please note that if you delete our Game from your device, we will not be notified and your personal data will remain stored with us. If you wish to access your data or request its deletion, please follow the instructions in Section 4.</p>

<h2>Personal data collected when using our ABSOLUTE CINEMA Game</h2>

<p>Below are some examples of the personal data we collect when you use our Application:</p>

<p>1. Device-related data (such as your IP address, device identifier and advertising identifier). This data is used in particular to provide you with access to our Game. As our Game contains advertisements, we may also use this data to provide you with better targeted or more relevant ads (unless you have disabled ad personalization in your device settings).</p>

<p>2. Login and contact details (your username, password, bio and email). In our Game, you may provide a username and a password. If you play our Game, we will store this information. The purpose is to allow you to log in to your account on multiple devices and to recover your password if you forget it.</p>

<p>We will also ask you for a bio (short biography), which is not mandatory, in order to complete your account. This bio may include, for example, your three favorite films.</p>

<p>3. History of your purchases made in the Game. When you make a purchase in our Game, we keep a record of such purchase in order to comply with regulatory obligations and to assist customer support in the event of an issue with your transaction.</p>

<p>4. Gameplay history. When you play our Game, we record information about your activity, such as your interactions or how long you played our Game (or the mini-games within the Application). This information is used to analyze the Game’s operation and helps us improve the Game.</p>

<p>5. Profile picture. In our Game, you may personalize your in-game avatar using your own profile picture, which could be a photo of you. In some cases, this means we will store your profile picture on our servers. Please refer to our General Terms of Use for more information.</p>

<p>6. Social network information. If you connect to our Game via a social network and your privacy settings allow it, TIMING CORPORATION may access certain information about you through that social network.
